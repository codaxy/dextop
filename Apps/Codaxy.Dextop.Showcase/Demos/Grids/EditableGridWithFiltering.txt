Editable Grid with filtering and sorting
=================

This demo has the ability to perform CRUD operations on a grid that represents repository of people.

Server-side filtering (using attributes name and age) and sorting (using every grid attribute) are implemented by writing queries on SortedDictionary.

Window consists of two areas implemented by using border layout. Right area is form that enables creating/updating capabilities of this demo.

Filtering has the time buffer of 200ms, which was created by using JS function setTimeout(). Because of that filter does not trigger server-side request for every character.
